Student: Anshul Saini (u4545909)
Supervisor: Dr. Lexing Xie
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the project?

As part of the Undergraduate Engineering Thesis, an Android Mobile Application was 
implemented, to allow users to view and browse videos for the available categories, 
as well as find matching videos to a selected video, on the basis of frame-matching
or 'visual meme tracking'.

Serverside Scripts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project required the implementation of the backend on the server, for the
application to communicate with. 

The python scripts that were needed for the development already exist on the Cantabile
server, in the appropriate locations. They have also been placed in the 
'ServerSide Scripts' directory for reference.


Doxygen Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of the deliverables, Doxygen files have been generated and added to the Github
repository. These can be accessed in the directory 'DoxygenFiles'.


Android Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code for the implementation of the application has been placed in the 'Android' 
directory. The Android layout has been maintained, as to allow for easy importing 
within Eclipse.
